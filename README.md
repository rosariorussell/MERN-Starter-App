# MERN Starter App ðŸš€

### Fully functional boilerplate code based on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, Node). Offers barebone app functionality with the following features:
* Quick deployment to Heroku and configured dev environment
* Start page acts as a project to-do list using MongoDB
* Secure login system using JSON Web Takens and cookies
* Minimal starting implementation of React Router, Redux Thunk, and Redux Form

#### Delete what you don't need. Or build on top and create a fully functional app in minutes.

## To Do
* remove google auth and replace with JWT and passport
* start page uses react router to link to sign up if not logged in or open tasks if logged in
* sign up page uses redux-form for validation
* adding/deleting a task goes through authentication middleware
* Navbar contains login or sign out based on auth reducer
* Update readme with video guide and instructions: install, heroku deploy, mlab addon, and config.example.js
* make app pretty with materialize
