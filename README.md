# MERN Starter App ðŸš€

### Fully functional boilerplate code based on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, Node). Minimal configuration, rapid deployment, and...
* Secure login system using Auth0
* State container using Redux
* Minimal implementation of React Router and Redux Form
* Landing page acts as a project to-do list using MongoDB and basic CRUD functionality
* Development and production environment already configured for testing and deploying to Heroku

#### Delete what you don't need. Or build on top and create a fully functional app in minutes.

## To Do
* Remove google auth and replace with Auth0
* Start page uses react router to link to sign up if not logged in or open tasks if logged in
* Sign up page uses redux-form for validation
* Adding/deleting a task goes through authentication middleware
* Navbar contains login or sign out based on auth reducer
* Prettify with materialize
* Update readme with video guide and instructions: install, heroku deploy, mlab addon, and config.example.js
* Merge with other project and share with others using scraper
